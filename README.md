# Phonepe-Pulse-Data-Visualization-and-Exploration

This project involves creating a user-friendly Streamlit application that utilizes the Google API to collect insightful data from YouTube channels. The acquired data is stored in MongoDB, then transitioned to a SQL data warehouse for analysis and exploration, all accessible through the Streamlit app.

Technologies Used:

# Python scripting
# Data Collection
# Streamlit
# SQL
# Plotly


# Approach:

# Data Extraction:
The data is obtained from the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository using scripting techniques and cloned for further processing.

# Data Transformation: 
Process the cloned data using Python algorithms to transform it into DataFrame format, ensuring it is clean and ready for analysis.

# Database Integration: 
The transformed data is inserted into a MySQL database, providing efficient storage and retrieval capabilities.

# Live Geo Visualization Dashboard: 
Utilizing Python's Streamlit and Plotly libraries, create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard. This real-time dashboard enables users to explore insights effectively.

# Database Integration with the Dashboard: 
Fetch relevant data from the MySQL database and seamlessly integrate it into the dashboard, ensuring that the displayed information is up-to-date and accurate.

# Visualization: 
Finally, create a dashboard using Streamlit, incorporating selection and dropdown options. Showcase the output through Geo visualization, bar charts, and a DataFrame table.
